This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled promise rejections.  The `bug.js` file showcases an asynchronous middleware function that can throw an error. However, it lacks proper error handling, leading to a silent crash. The solution (`bugSolution.js`) demonstrates the correct way to handle promise rejections, ensuring that the server remains operational and provides informative error messages.
